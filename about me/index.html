        I really enjoy spending time with my family and my friends, and I love camping. I'm excited to learn web development 
        because I really want to be able to design websites and provide service to businesses to have more smooth running, and aesthically
        pleasing websites.

        I joined the church when I was 8 years old and I've been a member my whole life. My most favorite church quote comes from Joseph Smith.
        He's said, "If you teach them correct principles, then they will govern themselves."
